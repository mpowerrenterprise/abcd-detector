## Train AI models with the Teachable Machine.

Teachable Machine is a Low-Code-AI tool that helps to train simple AI models to recognize images, sounds, & poses without coding experience. This tool is a gateway for beginners and enthusiasts, allowing them to train simple machine-learning models without extensive programming knowledge.

**Note:** Teachable Machine is not a good tool for developing enterprise applications; it can be used only for simple models and education purposes.

**Step 01:** Go to (https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com)

**Step 02:** Click ‚ÄúGet Started Button‚Äù:

**Note:** After that, other steps are self-explanatory: create classes according to your needs; then add data to the relevant classes and click train to start the training process. Apart from this, advanced settings can be changed to improve performance and accuracy. The model can be uploaded online or downloaded locally; it also provides basic code to infer the model in Python, a Web App (TensorFlow | TensorFlowJS | TensorFlow Litte).
